# Event configuration.
# It is possible for certain scoreboards to get triggered at certain events, and this can be configured here.
# Event configuration is slightly complex and limited however. There is no way to temporarily show scoreboards
# for a set time period.
# The configuration is defined such that the key is the full event class name, and that the value is the name
# of the scoreboard to switch to. The class name's "." are replaced with " ". Please note that the event must be
# a sub-class of "org.bukkit.event.player.PlayerEvent".

# When the player joins the server.
#org bukkit event player PlayerJoinEvent:
#  give: welcome # Gives the scoreboard "welcome" to the player.
#  for: 100 # Leaves the scoreboard for 100 ticks (set to -1 for infinity).
#  then: default # The scoreboard to switch back to afterwards (remove this for infinity).
